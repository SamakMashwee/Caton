Lemme explain why i'm the best
I do not take offense
Im practically wearing a bullet-proof vest
If you’re cool with me being blessed,

I’m supernatural shit
I must be possessed.
“Oh Spek, please gimme some rest”
Oh you’re girl saw now she impressed,

I put time and work in, I invest.
All cuz i’m just tryna be the best (I am)
I am better at being the best at greatness
All the stuff i be doing be outrageous

Spitting hot bars it's getting contagious
I know it’s confusing call it the matrix
Who are you? I don’t know what your name is (who are you?),

Make a diss on someone and they fall
People look up to me but i'm not tall (no I’m not)
Thinking you’re better than me, that’s a miscall.
I knock everyone away like a cue ball

I can switch up the flow like a curveball
No this ain’t a game, blues clues,
Make this shit hit the news, who the fuck are you
Now this shit i knew,
Writing poetry, call me Dr. Sue (Huh!?),
New to making raps by killing these tracks
Destroying everyone
Yeah these ain't no hacks
I am underrated, that is facts,

Come my way, you’re gonna get slapped
Cause i can rap, back to back
You be on snapchat, chat, chat, chat
Sorry boy I didn’t text you, back, back, back
Wanting me to respond, but everything you say be whack, whack whack. (whack whack),

Yeah this beat go hard
Shoot ya shot, ima bombard
I direct traffic like a crossing guard
I make music videos in my backyard

Attacking me thats the wrong card
How ya’ll getting destroyed by someone who’s fifteen
I get high with this beat I don’t need no green,
I destroy these tracks
I am mean.,

I make these racks
I ain’t got a team
Everything I spit is fax
This is shit you’ve never seen

People really must think I'm on lean (Yuh!)
Yuh im the best
I do not take offense’
I am practically wearing a bulletproof vest
Better than the rest
Cuz i am the best

Yuh

Better than the rest
Cuz i am the best
Thinking you’re better than me
Please come and try me,

You simply can’t see reality
Yeah my shit’s clean
I rap but I don’t sip on lean or the green
Yeah, you might as well call me Mr. Clean

Your shit’s dirty, you must shop at Ross.
I ain’t gotta boss coming at me that’s a big loss
Im collecting these checks like The Red Cross
Yeah I got the sauce,
but I ain’t no clown wearing lip gloss no.,

Yeah Im the best
I do not take offense
I’m practically wearing a bulletproof vest
Better than the rest
Cuz i am the best,

Yeah

Better than the rest
Cuz I am the best

Yuh.
